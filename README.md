# Drug Response Prediction using Transformer Models

## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of a deep learning model to predict drug response (IC50 values) using gene expression data and molecular fingerprints. The model leverages CNN, LSTM, and Transformer architectures to process different input modalities.

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or install manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy rdkit-pypi shap tensorflow keras-tuner scikit-learn matplotlib scipy
```

## Dataset
- The dataset should contain molecular SMILES strings, gene expression profiles, and IC50 values.
- Expected columns: `SAMPLE_ID`, `TCGA_DESC`, `DRUG_NAME`, `DRUG_ID`, `SMILES`, `IC50`, and gene expression features.
- Update `data_URL` in the script with the actual dataset path.

## Preprocessing
- Converts SMILES to Morgan fingerprints.
- Standardizes gene expression data.
- Splits dataset into training and testing sets.

## Model Architecture
- **CNN** for processing Morgan fingerprints.
- **LSTM** for sequential gene expression data.
- **Transformer Encoder** for capturing gene expression interactions.
- Merged multi-modal architecture for final prediction.

## Training
Run the model training:
```bash
python train.py
```
- Uses Early Stopping, Learning Rate Reduction, and Model Checkpoint callbacks.
- Best model is saved as `best_model.h5`.

## Evaluation
Evaluate the trained model:
```bash
python evaluate.py
```
- Outputs MSE, MAE, RÂ², and correlation metrics.
- Generates visualization plots (scatter plots, residuals, and training history).

## Results
- The model's performance is compared with existing models.
- Plots include Actual vs Predicted IC50 values and residuals.
- Results are saved in `ic50_prediction_results.csv`.

## Visualization
- Scatter plots of actual vs predicted IC50 values.
- Line plots comparing true vs predicted IC50.
- Model evaluation bar charts.
